/**
 * Hadoop Solution For Question 3 of Project 1 at Revature
 * Question 3: List the change in male employment since the year 2000
 * Solution Explanation:
 * 	A. Calculation
 * 		Take the most recent available data point from SL.EMP.TOTL.SP.MA.ZS and
 * 		the oldest since equal to or after 2000 and subtract the oldest from the
 * 		most recent.
 * 	B. Mapper
 * 		Finds SL.EMP.TOTL.SP.MA.ZS for each country after line 28890, which includes
 * 		everything including and after Afghanistan
 * 	C. Reducer
 * 		1. Search through the values for SL.EMP.TOTL.SP.MA.ZS from the most recent year
 * 			to the year 2001 and store the first value you come across
 * 		2. Do the same as 1 but from 2000 to 2015 and store that value
 * 		3. Subtract value from 2 from value from 1 and return that percentage difference
 * 	D. Post-analysis
 * 		TBD
 * Thought Process:
 * 	I wanted to find the change in employment percentage among males for each country
 *  from the year 2000 to the most recent year up to 2016.
 * Approach Applied to the problem:
 * 	I calculated the change in employment as the most recent available data point 
 * 	including and before 2016 in SL.EMP.TOTL.SP.MA.ZS minus the earliest data point
 *  including or after 2000.
 * Assumptions made:
 * 	I assumed that the question was asking for a list of percentage changes, one for each
 * 	country.
